<p>If you’re not familiar with Jekyll (or other &lt;a href="https://www.staticgen.com/" target="blank"&gt;website generators&lt;/a&gt;), Jekyll is a so-called static site generator. Think of it as a modern but lightweight Content Management System (CMS) - like &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="blank"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.joomla.org/" target="blank"&gt;Joomla&lt;/a&gt; but much, much simpler and without all the complexity.&lt;div class="admonitionblock note"&gt;  &lt;table&gt;    &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td class="icon"&gt;        &lt;i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;      &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;td class="content"&gt;        For many use cases, there is no need to use a full blown CMS        to manage a website. If you go the static way, no database is needed        and no PHP-based dynamic rendering engine that slows down the        performace of your website. For e.g. document servers like        &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs" target="blank"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; or        &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/" target="blank"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;, Jekyll is        used for good reasons.      &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;  &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;All you’re doing at the end of the day is writing your content and the builtin engines does all the tricky things in behind needed for a website: design pages, putting out HTML, CSS and Javascript. As a result, the site creation process gets out of your way. It’s done by J1 Template and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: &lt;strong&gt;your content&lt;/strong&gt;.</p>

<p>It is not a secret, that many options are available today to create and present a web. Content Management Systems like Wordpress or Online Services like Wix can be used to manage and present a website. CMS are fairly complex because of their nature. CMS are creating dynamic pages stored in database systems. And they are using complex programming interfaces to generate each and every page. On the other hand, a Online Service simplifies the process of creating a website a lot but you&#8217;re quite limited in what a Service Provider is giving you at your hands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To learn what is behind the scenes will be a quite challenging job if you go for a CMS. For Content Management Systems, expect a really steep learning curve to get an insight view. If you have plans using an Online Service, forget about learning. A provider won&#8217;t get you any insight view what&#8217;s happening in behind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; J1 is created to flatten the learning curve for learning how modern websites are being created. Using Jekyll One, people can start on a beginner level but simultaneously achive good results. That&#8217;s important for all users but especially for learners.
