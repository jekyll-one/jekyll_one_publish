# J1 Template MDE 4

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to
be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the
file `lib/j1`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for
an interactive prompt.

## Create the RubyGem

The creation process is controlled by the (gemspec) configuration file
*j1_template.gemspec*. This configuration is used by the Ruby
commandline utility `gem` called like so:

``` sh
gem build j1_template.gemspec
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'j1_template', '~> 2021.1.0'
```

and install the locally created RubGem as:

``` sh
gem install --local j1_template --no-document
```

## Usage

To install a Starter Web, simply run:

``` sh
j1 generate starter
```

This will create a general purpose skeleton under folder `starter`. To startup
a Web using Jekyll, run on *Linux* or *MacOS*:

``` sh
cd starter
j1server.sh
```
or on *Windows*:

``` sh
cd starter
j1server.bat
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can
also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
