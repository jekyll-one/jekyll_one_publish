# J1 Template SASS sourcen

The gem-based version of J1 comes with *no* CSS/SASS files. For developing
respectively changing the CSS sources, go for the J1 Development System at:
Github [jekyll-one/j1_template](https://github.com/jekyll-one-org/J1 Template).

To use CSS/SASS files for development with the RubyGem version, copy the
folder scss out of the package `100_template_css` under `_sass` in the root
directory of your Jekyll Web. 

To enable SASS processing, edit the SASS documents in folder 
*/assets/themes/j1/core/css*. The frontmatters of the SASS documents 
enables Jekyll to read the SASS file to be transformed into CSS.
To enble SASS processing, change the *five* dashes into *triple* dashes.
