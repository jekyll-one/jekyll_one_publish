          description: >
                                        Creating and managing Web sites using Jekyll is different
                                        in compare to CMS Systems like Drupal, Joomla oder Wordpress.
                                        No surprise: Jekyll One Template is <b>different</b> as well.
                                        Template systems are very common, a huge number of site
                                        templates are available for all CMS and Web site generators.
                                        The same to Jekyll. J1 Template is <b>not</b> the first
                                        template for Jekyll available - it is probably the <b>youngest</b>!
                                        <br \><br \>
                                        Classic templates are focussing the <b>layout</b> and <b>design</b>
                                        of a web. They offer pre-build, standardized <b>building blocks</b>
                                        and tools <b>designing</b> web sites. The are embedded into the
                                        creators system and often hard to customize. J1 for Jekyll goes different.
                                        J1 Template combines layout, design and <b>functionality</b> for a web.
                                        The template offers building blocks to create common page components,
                                        implements a sytem independend markup language (Asciidoc and Markdown)
                                        to create the content and adds a large number of usefull functions based
                                        on common Javascript libraries for the web from a single source. That way,
                                        J1 web sites behaves as one unit in design <b>and</b> functionality.
                                        No breaks between the different components.
