                                        Jekyll One Template. Gem-based template made for Jekyll.
                                        J1 meets Jekyll and Bootstrap. And makes a lot of friends.
                                        The template system combines the best of free software for
                                        the web.
                                        Jekyll One Template is OpenSource and the modules included
                                        are free to use as well.

<pre>
  This page is created by the layout: {{ page.layout }}.

  If this text is displayed (instead of the home page expected),
  something went  wrong with the layout definitions. Check  the
  output of the Jekyll engine building this site.

  Check the  contents   of folder _layouts. Verify  if the base
  layout  "{{ page.layout }}" exists  and the  referring  chain
  (inheritance) is correct.

  If you see this page within the J1 Template DEVELOPMENT system,
  re-run a site built running:

    yarn rebuild site

  If you're on a RUNTIME system run a built like so:

    yarn rebuild

  and open the website again by:

    yarn site
