1740: Young Jamie Fraser has left Scotland and, with his best friend Ian Murray,
is running with a band of mercenaries in France.

Both men have good reason not to go back to their homeland: both are nursing
wounds, and despite their best efforts to remedy the situation, both are still
virgins. So when a Jewish doctor hires them to escort his granddaughter to
Paris, they readily agree. Both men are instantly drawn to the beautiful young
lady.

Find out what happened before Jamie met Claire in this brilliant new Outlander
short story. What neither know is that their lives and their friendships are
about to become infinitely more complicated - and a lot more dangerous...
