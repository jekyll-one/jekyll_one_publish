Tilly Dunnage left her hometown of Dungatar in rural Australia under a black
cloud of accusation. Years later Tilly, now a couturier for the Paris fashion
houses, returns home to make amends with her mentally unstable mother.

Mid-century Dungatar is a small town, and small towns have long memories.
At first she wins over the suspicious locals with her extraordinary
dressmaking skills. But when the eccentric townsfolk turn on Tilly for a
second time, she decides to teach them a lesson and exact long-overdue
revenge.

Packed with memorable characters, acid humour and luscious clothes,
The Dressmaker is an irresistible gothic tale of small-town revenge.
