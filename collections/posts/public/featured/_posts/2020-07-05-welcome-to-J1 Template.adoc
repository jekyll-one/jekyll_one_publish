If you’re not familiar with Jekyll (or other site generators), Jekyll is a
so-called static site generator. Think of it like a CMS but without all the 
complexity and headache. No need to build a giant content strangling Rube 
Goldberg machine to manage content.

All you’re doing at the end of the day is writing your content and Jekyll does
all the tricky things needed for a web site: putting out HTML, Javascript
and CSS. As a result, the site creation process gets out of your way, it's done
by Jekyll, and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

All you’re doing at the end of the day is writing your content and Jekyll does
all the tricky things needed for a web site: putting out HTML, Javascript
and CSS. As a result, the site creation process gets out of your way, it's done
by Jekyll, and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

A static site serve the content straight to the user as it is stored on
the server side. To put it in another way, in opposition to WordPress
which use a database to load dynamic content, a static site will display
the same content to every user as it will directly load the HTML files
on the server.

=== What is different?

What are the differences between a static site and a dynamic website?

To make it simple, a dynamic website uses a database and PHP/MySQL to
generate the content of a page when a user will request it. For example,
building a website using WordPress CMS will result in having a dynamic
website.

=== Why use a static site?

Wat are the advantages of a static website over a dynamic site?
You may be wondering “Why should I build a static site when I could do a
WordPress?”. Well, having a database implies a lot of downsides. Here
comes the tree main advantages of using a static site over a dynamic
one.

Static: the better performance and a crazy fast load time!

One the of the main advantages of using a static site is the fact that
it is crazy fast to load. Indeed, when the user request a page, there is
no need to request a database and various files in order to generate the
page itself as all the content is already placed in a one and only file:
an HTML one. That’s why, by using a static site you will get a boost in
your loading time that will provide great user experience for the
internauts. Moreover, we know that more and more people are surfing the
web using their smartphones with, sometimes, poor internet connections,
that’s why having fast loading times will participate in making your
website mobile friendly.

== Security aspects

Having a static website: say goodbye to hacking and security issues!

Tired of getting WordPress notifications about security issues and
updates every week? No worries, as a static site has no database, there
are close to no hack possible compared to a WordPress website. Indeed,
your site will have way less footprints and security issues since it
will only load plain HTML and CSS files. The security gain in having a
static website is one the main reason why many famous brands switch to
static site instead of having their website on Drupal or WordPress.

== Building and Hosting

Building a static site and hosting: you will save you money!

Using a static site, you will only have most of the time only HTML and
CSS files to host. This kind of files are super light which also means
that you will not need a powerhouse hosting to have a static site up and
running. Moreover, if your traffic suddenly increase, your site will not
go down contrary to a dynamic site which should request the database
each time for each user.

== Why use a site generator?

Working with HTML files can sometimes be quite annoying. Indeed, if you
need to make a modification you must manually change every file. If you
have a website with 10 pages, it can be ok but imagine if you have a
corporate site with 100+ pages or a blog with thousands of pages?! Using
a static site generator will solve this issue as it separates the
content and the template. To say it another way, by using a static site
generator you will only need to make the modification once and the
generator will apply it to all your pages.

=== Why Jekyll?

As the popularity of static sites is growing, there are plenty of static
site generators available on the market. The more famous are Jekyll,
Middleman and Hugo. Each one has its own specificities and may suits you
better depending on the programming languages you already are familiar
with.

Which static site generator should I use?

When I wanted to switch from WordPress to Static I personally
choose Jekyll as for me it is the best static site generator so far.
This blog is powered under Jekyll.

Happy Jekylling!
