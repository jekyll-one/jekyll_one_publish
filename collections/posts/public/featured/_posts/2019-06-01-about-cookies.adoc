Is it needed for vistors to know what cookies are all about?

Not first place. Cookies are widely used. All users visting web sites are 
bothered all the time to accept on cookies. Because cookies are used that often. 
For good reasons - but for *different* reasons. 

To answer the question: yes, you should.

All people are part of the *real* and virtual worlds as well; the internet 
for example. In real world you've learned what cookies are. You can simply 
*see* them, smell them and eat some. In real world cookies are *real*, you
know sweets from earliest days.

But cookies in the digital world are different. Cookies in the sense of the 
internet, of the web are *not* dangerous but not nessearily a sort of sweets
to enjoy people.

In short words. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your
browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the 
website to "remember" your actions or preferences over time.

Most browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline 
them and can delete them whenever they like.

Good to know.

== For what reasons cookies are used

Websites mainly use cookies for:

Identification::
identify users

General information storage::
remember users' custom preferences

Support::
help users complete tasks without having to re‑enter information 
when browsing from one page to another or when visiting the site later.

Track behavioural::
Cookies can also be used for online behavioural target advertising and to 
show adverts relevant to something that the user searched for in the past.

The web server supplying the webpage can store a cookie on the user's 
computer or mobile device. An external web server that manages files 
included or referenced in the webpage is also able to store cookies. 

All these cookies are called http header cookies. Another way of storing 
cookies is through JavaScript code contained or referenced in that page.

Each time the user requests a new page, the web server can receive the 
values of the cookies it previously set and return the page with content
relating to these values. Similarly, JavaScript code is able to read a
cookie belonging to its domain and perform an action accordingly.


.How are they used
[NOTE]
====
The web server supplying the webpage can store a cookie on the user's 
computer or mobile device. An external web server that manages files included 
or referenced in the webpage is also able to store cookies. All these 
cookies are called http header cookies. Another way of storing cookies is
through JavaScript code contained or referenced in that page.

Each time the user requests a new page, the web server can receive the
values of the cookies it previously set and return the page with content
relating to these values. Similarly, JavaScript code is able to read a
cookie belonging to its domain and perform an action accordingly.

== Types of cookies

A cookie can be classified by its lifespan and the domain to which it belongs. 
By lifespan, a cookie is either a:

Session cookie::
which is erased when the user closes the browser or

Persistent cookie::
which remains on the user's computer/device for a pre-defined period of time.

As for the domain to which it belongs, there are either:

First-party cookie::
cookies which are set by the web server of the visited page and share the 
same domain

Third-party cookies::
cookies stored by a different domain to the visited page's domain. 
This can happen when the webpage references a file, such as JavaScript, 
located outside its domain.


== How do a site use cookies?

Adjust this part of the page according to your needs.

Explain which cookies you use in plain, jargon-free language. In particular:

*	their purpose and the reason why they are being used, (e.g. to remember 
users' actions, to identify the user, for online behavioural advertising) 
*	if they are essential for the website or a given functionality to work 
or if they aim to enhance the performance of the website
*	the types of cookies used (e.g. session or permanent, first or third-party)
*	who controls/accesses the cookie-related information (website or third party)
*	that the cookie will not be used for any purpose other than the one stated
*	how consent can be withdrawn.

You can use as example the top level "cookie notice" of the Commission homepage.
If your site does not use any cookies, just declare it (e.g. The Information 
Providers Guide site does not use any cookies). If your site uses the same 
cookies as the Commission homepage, you can just link to the top level 
cookie notice.


== How to control cookies

You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, 
see http://www.aboutcookies.org[aboutcookies.org]. You can delete 
all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most 
browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, 
you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit 
a site and some services and functionalities may not work.
