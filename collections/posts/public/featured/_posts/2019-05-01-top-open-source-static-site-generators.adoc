A typical CMS driven website works by building each and every page dynamically.
That means fetching the content from a database to pass them over to a template
system for adding the required structure information (e.g. CSS styles).
This means each page is assembled on demand.

=== Is an CMS needed?

For many, many websites dynamic page generation is entirely unnecessary and
adds unwanted risks in terms of complexity, performance losses and security
issues. After all, the content of most websites changes only, when the content
authors make changes.

Why the hell should a web page always assembled on demand if there are no
changes?

NOTE: To be fair, most CMS are providing caching systems for web pages to
prevent unnecessary creation processes. It is not easy to implement such
a caching strategy, and in the very end, it adds the next level of
complexity.

A Static Site Generator takes a different approach and generates all the pages
of the website upfront. That does not necessarily mean that a static website
is always built from scratch. Modern generators support a so-called
incremental build; like Jekyll does. When there are changes detected to the
content, only selected pages will rebuild.

This means overall, statically build web pages having no moving parts in the
deployed website. This results in browser-side caching only, the performance
goes up, and static sites are far more secure because they build already.
