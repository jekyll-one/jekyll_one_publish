The typical CMS driven website works by building each page on-demand, fetching
content from a database and running it through a template engine. This means
each page is assembled from templates and content on each request to the
server.

For most sites this is completely unnecessary overhead and only adds
complexity, performance problems and security issues. After all, by far
the most websites only change when the content authors or their design
team makes changes.

A Static Site Generator takes a different approach and generate all the pages
of the website once when there’s actually changes to the site. This means
there’s no moving parts in the deployed website. Caching gets much easier,
performance goes up and static sites are far more secure.

To find out what Open-Source Static Site Generators are available today and
their ranking in terms of popularity you should check https://www.staticgen.com/[StaticGen].

On StaticGen, you'll will find the most complete list of generators!

Have fun!
