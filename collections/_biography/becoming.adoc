In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged 
as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of 
the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that 
role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, 
while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls 
in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families 
pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he 
led America through some of its most harrowing moments.

Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and 
raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. 

In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, 
Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences 
that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to 
her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, 
to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty 
and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both 
public and protected, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own 
words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the 
deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily 
defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.
