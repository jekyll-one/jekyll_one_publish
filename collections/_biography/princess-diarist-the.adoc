The Princess Diarist is Carrie Fisher's intimate, hilarious and revealing
recollection of what happened behind the scenes on one of the most famous
film sets of all time, the first Star Wars movie.

When Carrie Fisher recently discovered the journals she kept during the
filming of the first Star Wars movie, she was astonished to see what they
had preserved-plaintive love poems, unbridled musings with youthful naivete,
and a vulnerability that she barely
recognized.

Today, her fame as an author, actress, and pop-culture icon is indisputable,
but in 1977, Carrie Fisher was just a (sort-of) regular teenager.

With these excerpts from her handwritten notebooks, The Princess Diarist is
Fisher's intimate and revealing recollection of what happened on one of the
most famous film sets of all time-and what developed behind the scenes. And
today, as she reprises her most iconic role for the latest Star Wars trilogy,
Fisher also ponders the joys and insanity of celebrity, and the absurdity of
a life spawned by Hollywood royalty, only to be surpassed by her own outer-space
royalty.

Laugh-out-loud hilarious and endlessly quotable, The Princess Diarist brims
with the candour and introspection of a diary while offering shrewd insight
into the type of stardom that few will ever experience.
