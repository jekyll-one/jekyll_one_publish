One day he was a doctor treating the dying, the next he was a patient
struggling to live. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's
transformation from a medical student asking what makes a virtuous and
meaningful life into a neurosurgeon working in the core of human identity -
the brain - and finally into a patient and a new father. What makes life
worth living in the face of death? What do you do when when life is
catastrophically interrupted? What does it mean to have a child as your
own life fades away?
