Sir Terry Pratchett left us, far too early, in March 2015. To celebrate his
life and works, we've given over the 2017 Discworld Diary - which will be a
perennial diary - to remembrances and tributes from some of those who knew
and loved him and his extraordinary body of work.

Contributors include Neil Gaiman, A S Byatt, Terry Pratchett's literary agent
Colin Smythe, co-author of the Long Earth books Stephen Baxter, famed
bookseller Rog Peyton, and many more.

With an introduction from his daughter Rhianna Pratchett and an afterword from
longtime friend and colleague Rob Wilkins.
