A good user experience browsing a Web site is one of the most important
feature a site has to offer as a must. Beside excellent content. Presenting
content at its best on all devices, for all window sizes makes an excellent
Web brilliant. J1 Template supports your Web for full responsiveness, for
the best user experience on all modern devices.

=== Bootstrap 4 Integration

To not sidetrack your audience by irritating user interface (UI) components,
J1 Template is based on Bootstrap. Bootstrap is one of the most popular
frameworks for web development used today. J1 is based on Bootstrap V4, the
last current version to support your visitors by common elements for navigation,
data input, tables, and many other components more.

For your development projects, Bootstrap simplifies HTML programming a lot,
offers excellent JS support for interactive components like navigation
elements, cards, forms, etc.

The Internet is a rapidly changing world. Like the fashion industries, new
trends are set every year. J1 Template combines modern technologies for the
world of static Webs to make a site unique using current standards in terms
of web development, languages, and tools.

=== HTML5 + CSS3

J1 is using HTML5 for structuring content on the World Wide Web. The current
version of the HTML standard offers a lot of new features including detailed
processing models to support more interoperable implementations. It extends
and improves HTML markups available. HTML5 introduces application programming
interfaces (APIs) for more complex web applications. For the same reasons,
the new HTML standard is also a good choice for modern cross-platform mobile
applications, because it includes features designed with mobile devices in mind.

Many new features are included with HTML5. To natively support multimedia and
graphical content, the new <video>, <audio> and <canvas> elements were added.
Besides this, support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) and an API called
MathML for mathematical formulas are now available.

The new standard allows to use so-called semantic markup elements for your
documents. New structure elements such as <main>, <section>, <article>,
<header> or <footer> (and many more) were added. Better structured HTML code
can help people having disabilities to read the pages presented better.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content. Including
layout, colors, and fonts for example. This separation improves content
accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the presentation.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the
same page in different styles. For example, the themes feature of J1 Template
makes use of this.

CSS3 is divided into several separate components called modules. Each module
adds new capabilities or extends features defined in the former CSS2 standard.
HTML5 in combination with CSS3 allows creating modern and modular code for
web pages that can be viewed on all current devices like Mobiles, Tablets,
or the classic Desktop PC. The new HTML5 elements plus CSS3 modules can be
used as a replacement for proprietary solutions like Adobe Flash to build
modern webpages based on open standards.

=== Javascript

HTML5 and CSS3 can do a lot. Content placement and basic methods for the
dynamic of elements can be done using pure HTML5 and CSS3. For more complex
solutions like modules, the support of Javascript is needed.

J1 Template has build-in a wide range of JS-powered modules to support a
website e.g. the navigation, for presenting image data in galleries,
lightboxes, and so on.


[[launch-ready]]
== Start in No Time

[role="mb-3"]

The base idea of the J1 Template is to give all people a toolset at their
hands to create a website with no need to start by web development or
web design from the beginning. A website based on J1 is using build-in
templates and engines. As a result, the process to generate HTML code from
your content is done automatically and allows you to concentrate on what
truly matters: your content.

Using J1, you can instantly start a web project by creating your content and
not by start learning the deep web development technologies.

=== Create your Web

J1 is highly customizable. Based on a pure configuration, a website can be
created. The template system creates static web pages using Jekyll as the
base HTML code generator. Static websites are fast and secure but simple
to manage. No complex database systems and PHP interfaces are needed.

To present a static website, only a web server environment is needed. To
publish a website on the Internet, many possible platforms can be used like
Github, Netlify, or Heroku for example - for free!

The Internet is not a peaceful place. Every site accessible from the public
is attacked from the first second if published. Static websites are robust,
fast and that’s import: intrinsically secure. That means: not changeable.
No offender attacking your website can break your site. Because it’s static
or in other words: unchangeable, unbreakable from its nature.

This makes a static website for the better.

=== Modules and Apps

It’s predictable what base components are needed for a modern website. For
Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal a huge
number of modules are available to extend a site by e.g. Apps like image
galleries, video players, calendars, etc.

This is a bit different for static webs as they don’t have a central Management
System as CMS does to integrate external code. There no ecosystem, no
marketplace to get apps and modules from.

Luckily, it is not that hard to integrate external components into the world
of Jekyll. But one of the objectives of J1 is to give people a ready-to-use
toolset without the need to install, to integrate components that are expected
as a need.

A rich set of modules are already included. The modules support common use
cases of a website like a flexible navigation system, a local search,
lightboxes to present pictures and videos, little helpers for scrolling or
to automatically create TOCs (table of contents) for a page.
