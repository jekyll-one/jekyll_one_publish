_Patron_ allows fans -- the *patrons* -- to pay creators for their work. Many
of these creators are influencers: photographers on Instagram, comedians
on YouTube, podcasters that tweet, creative technicians providing useful
software, tools and tutorials.

Simple like this.


== Become a Patron

What does that mean? A _Patron_ support a _Creator_ for the provided content
they love, they like to use: excellent content services -- created with passion.

What does a creator need to provide outstanding, useful products to the people?

No surprise: time and money. What is, vice versa, quite the same. But that's not
all.
