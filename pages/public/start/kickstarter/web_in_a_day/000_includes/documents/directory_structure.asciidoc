== Folder structure

Jekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. The concept behind the
system is this: you give it text written in your favorite markup language, be
that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, and it churns that through a layout
or a series of layout files. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want
the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more. This
is all done through editing text files; the static web site is the final
product.

A basic Jekyll site usually looks something like this:

[source, sh]

== Dirs and Files

An overview of what each of these does:

[width="100%", cols="4,8",options="header", role="table-responsive mt-3"]
|=======================================================================
|File / Directory |Description
|`_config.yml` |Stores link:../configuration/[configuration] data. Many
of these options can be specified from the command line executable but
it's easier to specify them here so you don't have to remember them.

|`_drafts` |Drafts are unpublished posts. The format of these files is
without a date: `title.MARKUP`. Learn how to link:../drafts/[work with
drafts].

|`_includes` |These are the partials that can be mixed and matched by
your layouts and posts to facilitate reuse. The liquid tag
`{% include file.ext %}` can be used to include the
partial in `_includes/file.ext`.

|`_layouts` |These are the templates that wrap posts. Layouts are chosen
on a post-by-post basis in the link:../frontmatter/[YAML Front Matter],
which is described in the next section. The liquid tag
`{{ content }}` is used to inject content into the
web page.

|`_posts` |Your dynamic content, so to speak. The naming convention of
these files is important, and must follow the format:
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`. The link:../permalinks/[permalinks] can
be customized for each post, but the date and markup language are
determined solely by the file name.

|`_data` |Well-formatted site data should be placed here. The Jekyll
engine will autoload all YAML files in this directory (using either the
`.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json` or `.csv` formats and extensions) and they will
be accessible via `site.data`. If there's a file `members.yml` under the
directory, then you can access contents of the file through
`site.data.members`.

|`_site` |This is where the generated site will be placed (by default)
once Jekyll is done transforming it. It's probably a good idea to add
this to your `.gitignore` file.

|`.jekyll-metadata` |This helps Jekyll keep track of which files have
not been modified since the site was last built, and which files will
need to be regenerated on the next build. This file will not be included
in the generated site. It's probably a good idea to add this to your
`.gitignore` file.

|`index.html` and other HTML, Markdown, Textile files |Provided that the
file has a link:../frontmatter/[YAML Front Matter] section, it will be
transformed by Jekyll. The same will happen for any `.html`,
`.markdown`, `.md`, or `.textile` file in your site's root directory or
directories not listed above.

|Other Files/Folders |Every other directory and file except for those
listed aboveÔÇösuch as `css` and `images` folders, `favicon.ico` files,
and so forthÔÇöwill be copied verbatim to the generated site. There are
plenty of link:../sites/[sites already using Jekyll] if you're curious
to see how they're laid out.
