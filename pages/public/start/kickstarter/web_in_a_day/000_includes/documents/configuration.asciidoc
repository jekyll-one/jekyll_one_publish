====
Jekyll allows you to configure your sites in any way you can dream up, and it’s
thanks to the powerful and flexible configuration options that this is possible.

These options can either be specified in a `&#x5F;config.yml` file placed in your
site’s root directory, or can be specified as flags for the `jekyll` executable
on command-line.
====

== Global Configuration

The table below lists the available settings for Jekyll, and the various
`options` (specified in the configuration file) and `flags` (specified on the
command-line) that control them.

[width="100%", cols="8,4",options="header", role="table-responsive mt-3"]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Options and Flags
a|
*Site Source*

Change the directory where Jekyll will read files

 a|
`source: DIR`

`-s, --source DIR`

a|
*Site Destination*

Change the directory where Jekyll will write files

 a|
`destination: DIR`

`-d, --destination DIR`

a|
*Safe*

Disable link:../plugins/[custom plugins, and ignore symbolic links].

 a|
`safe: BOOL`

`--safe`

a|
*Exclude*

Exclude directories and/or files from the conversion. These exclusions
are relative to the site's source directory and cannot be outside the
source directory.

 |`exclude: [DIR, FILE, ...]`

a|
*Include*

Force inclusion of directories and/or files in the conversion.
`.htaccess` is a good example since dotfiles are excluded by default.

 |`include: [DIR, FILE, ...]`

a|
*Keep files*

When clobbering the site destination, keep the selected files. Useful
for files that are not generated by jekyll; e.g. files or assets that
are generated by your build tool. The paths are relative to the
`destination`.

 |`keep&#x5F;files: [DIR, FILE, ...]`

a|
*Time Zone*

Set the time zone for site generation. This sets the `TZ` environment
variable, which Ruby uses to handle time and date creation and
manipulation. Any entry from the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz&#x5F;database[IANA Time Zone Database] is
valid, e.g. `America/New&#x5F;York`. A list of all available values can be
found
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List&#x5F;of&#x5F;tz&#x5F;database&#x5F;time&#x5F;zones[here]. The
default is the local time zone, as set by your operating system.

 |`timezone: TIMEZONE`

a|
*Encoding*

Set the encoding of files by name (only available for Ruby 1.9 or
later). The default value is `utf-8` starting in 2.0.0, and `nil` before
2.0.0, which will yield the Ruby default of `ASCII-8BIT`. Available
encodings can be shown by the command
`ruby -e 'puts Encoding::list.join("\n")'`.

 |`encoding: ENCODING`

a|
*Defaults*

Set defaults for link:../frontmatter/[YAML Front Matter] variables.

 |see link:#front-matter-defaults[below]
|=======================================================================


[WARNING]
====
Destination folders are cleaned on site builds.

The contents of `<destination>` are automatically cleaned, by default, when
the site is built. Files or folders that are not created by your site will
be removed. Some files could be retained by specifying them within the
`<keep_files>` configuration directive.

Do not use an important location for `<destination>` instead, use it as a
staging area and copy files from there to your web server.

== Build Command Options

[width="100%", cols="8,4",options="header", role="table-responsive mt-3"]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Options and Flags
a|
*Regeneration*

Enable auto-regeneration of the site when files are modified.

 |`-w, --[no-]watch`

a|
*Configuration*

Specify config files instead of using `&#x5F;config.yml` automatically.
Settings in later files override settings in earlier files.

 |`--config FILE1[,FILE2,...]`

a|
*Drafts*

Process and render draft posts.

 a|
`show&#x5F;drafts: BOOL`

`--drafts`

a|
*Environment*

Use a specific environment value in the build.

 |`JEKYLL&#x5F;ENV=production`

a|
*Future*

Publish posts or collection documents with a future date.

 a|
`future: BOOL`

`--future`

a|
*LSI*

Produce an index for related posts.

 a|
`lsi: BOOL`

`--lsi`

a|
*Limit Posts*

Limit the number of posts to parse and publish.

 a|
`limit&#x5F;posts: NUM`

`--limit&#x5F;posts NUM`

a|
*Force polling*

Force watch to use polling.

 |`--force&#x5F;polling`

a|
*Verbose output*

Print verbose output.

 |`-V, --verbose`

a|
*Silence Output*

Silence the normal output from Jekyll during a build

 |`-q, --quiet`

a|
*Incremental build*

Enable the experimental incremental build feature. Incremental build
only re-builds posts and pages that have changed, resulting in
significant performance improvements for large sites, but may also break
site generation in certain cases.

 a|
`incremental: BOOL`

`-I, --incremental`

a|
*Liquid profiler*

Generate a Liquid rendering profile to help you identify performance
bottlenecks.

 a|
`profile: BOOL`

`--profile`

|=======================================================================


== Serve Command Options

In addition to the options below, the `serve` sub-command can accept any of
the options for the `build` sub-command, which are then applied to the site
build which occurs right before your site is served.

[width="100%", cols="8,4",options="header", role="table-responsive mt-3"]
|======================================================================
|Setting |Options and Flags
a|
*Local Server Port*

Listen on the given port.

 a|
`port: PORT`

`--port PORT`

a|
*Local Server Hostname*

Listen at the given hostname.

 a|
`host: HOSTNAME`

`--host HOSTNAME`

a|
*X.509 (SSL) Certificate*

SSL Public certificate.

 |`--ssl-cert`
|======================================================================

[WARNING]
====
Do not use tabs in configuration files.

This will either lead to parsing errors, or Jekyll will revert to the
default settings. Use spaces instead.
====

== Custom WEBrick Headers

The Jekyll `serve` command enables an internal Web server - `WEBrick` - to 
serve your site without the need of an external Webserver (like Apache or Nginx).
To control the internal server, you can provide custom headers for your site
by adding them to `&#x5F;config.yml`

[source, yaml]
--------------
  # File: _config.yml
  webrick:
    headers:
      My-Header: My-Value
      My-Other-Header: My-Other-Value
--------------

=== Defaults

We provide by default `Content-Type` and `Cache-Control` response headers: one
dynamic in order to specify the nature of the data being served, the other
static in order to disable caching so that you don't have to fight with
Chrome's aggressive caching when you are in development mode.

== Set a Jekyll environment

You can specify a Jekyll environment at build time. In the build (or serve)
arguments, you can specify a Jekyll environment and value. The build will then
apply this value in any conditional statements in your content.

For example, suppose you set this conditional statement in your code:

[source, liquid]
--------------
  {% raw %}
  {% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}
     {% include disqus.html %}
  {% endif %}
  {% endraw %}
--------------

When you build your Jekyll site, the content inside the `if` statement won't
be run unless you also specify a `production` environment in the build
command, like this:

[source, sh]
--------------
  JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build
--------------

Specifying an environment value allows you to make certain content available
only within specific environments.

The default value for `JEKYLL&#x5F;ENV` is `development`. Therefore if you
omit `JEKYLL&#x5F;ENV` from the build arguments, the default value will be
`JEKYLL&#x5F;ENV=development`. Any content inside

[source, liquid]
--------------
  {% if jekyll.environment == "development" %}
--------------

tags will automatically appear in the build.

Your environment values can be anything you want (not just `development` or
`production`). Some elements you might want to hide in development environments
include Disqus comment forms or Google Analytics. Conversely, you might want
to expose an "Edit me in GitHub" button in a development environment but not
include it in production environments.

By specifying the option in the build command, you avoid having to change
values in your configuration files when moving from one environment to another.

== Front Matter defaults

Using YAML Front Matter is one way that you can specify configuration in the
pages and posts for your site. Setting things like a default layout, or
customizing the title, or specifying a more precise date/time for the post
can all be added to your page or post front matter.

Often times, you will find that you are repeating a lot of configuration
options. Setting the same layout in each file, adding the same
category - or categories - to a post, etc. You can even add custom variables
like author names, which might be the same for the majority of posts on
your blog.

Instead of repeating this configuration each time you create a new post or
page, Jekyll provides a way to set these defaults in the site configuration.
To do this, you can specify site-wide defaults using the `defaults` key in
the `&#x5F;config.yml` file in your project's root directory.

The `defaults` key holds an array of scope/values pairs that define what
defaults should be set for a particular file path, and optionally, a file
type in that path.

Let's say that you want to add a default layout to all pages and posts in
your site. You would add this to your `&#x5F;config.yml` file:

[source, yaml]
--------------
defaults:
  - scope:
      path:       ""        # an empty string here means all files in the project
    values:
      layout:     "default"
--------------

[NOTE]
====
Please stop and rerun `jekyll serve` command.

The `&#x5F;config.yml` master configuration file contains global
configurations and variable definitions that are read once at execution time.
Changes made to `&#x5F;config.yml` during automatic regeneration
are not loaded until the next execution.

Note `Data Files` are included and reloaded during automatic regeneration.

====

Here, we are scoping the `values` to any file that exists in the path `scope`.
Since the path is set as an empty string, it will apply to **all files** in
your project. You probably don't want to set a layout on every file in your
project - like css files, for example - so you can also specify a `type` value
under the `scope` key.

[source, yaml]
--------------
defaults:
  - scope:
      path:     ""      # an empty string here means all files in the project
      type:     "posts" # previously `post` in Jekyll 2.2.
    values:
      layout:   "default"
--------------

Now, this will only set the layout for files where the type is `posts`.
The different types that are available to you are `pages`, `posts`, `drafts`
or any collection in your site. While `type` is optional, you must specify a
value for `path` when creating a `scope|values` pair.

As mentioned earlier, you can set multiple scope/values pairs for `defaults`.

[source, yaml]
--------------
defaults:
  - scope:
      path:     ""
      type:     "posts"
    values:
      layout:   "my-site"

  - scope:
      path:     "projects"
      type:     "pages" # previously `page` in Jekyll 2.2.
    values:
      layout:   "project" # overrides previous default layout
      author:   "Mr. Hyde"
--------------

With these defaults, all posts would use the `my-site` layout. Any html files
that exist in the `projects/` folder will use the `project` layout, if it
exists. Those files will also have the `page.author` liquid variable
set to `Mr. Hyde`.

[source, yaml]
--------------
collections:
  - my_collection:
      output: true

defaults:
  - scope:
      path:       ""
      type:       "my_collection"   # a collection in your site, in plural form
    values:
      layout:     "default"
--------------

In this example, the `layout` is set to `default` inside the collection with 
the name `my&#x5F;collection`.

=== Precedence

Jekyll will apply all of the configuration settings you specify in the
`defaults` section of your `&#x5F;config.yml` file. However, you can choose
to override settings from other scope/values pair by specifying a more specific
path for the scope.

You can see that in the second to last example above. First, we set the default
layout to `my-site`. Then, using a more specific path, we set the default
layout for files in the `projects/` path to `project`. This can be done with
any value that you would set in the page or post front matter.

Finally, if you set defaults in the site configuration by adding a `defaults`
section to your `&#x5F;config.yml` file, you can override those settings in a
post or page file. All you need to do is specify the settings in the post or
page front matter.

For example:

[source, yaml]
--------------
# ~/_config.yml
...
defaults:
  - scope:
      path:       "projects"
      type:       "pages"
    values:
      layout:     "project"
      author:     "Mr. Hyde"
      category:   "project"
...
--------------

[source, yaml]
--------------
# ~/projects/foo_project.md
---
author: "John Smith"
layout: "foobar"
---
The post text goes here...
--------------

The `projects/foo&#x5F;project.md` would have the `layout` set to `foobar` 
instead of `project` and the `author` set to `John Smith` instead of `Mr. Hyde` 
when the site is built.

== Default Configuration

Jekyll runs with the following configuration options by default. Alternative
settings for these options can be explicitly specified in the configuration
file or on the command-line.

[WARNING]
====
There are two unsupported kramdown options.

Please note that both `remove&#x5F;block&#x5F;html&#x5F;tags` and
`remove&#x5F;span&#x5F;html&#x5F;tags` are currently *unsupported*
in Jekyll due to the fact that they are not included within the kramdown
HTML converter.

== Liquid Options

Liquid's response to errors can be configured by setting `error&#x5F;mode`.
The options are

- `lax` --- Ignore all errors.
- `warn` --- Output a warning on the console for each error.
- `strict` --- Output an error message and stop the build.

== Markdown Options

The various Markdown renderers supported by Jekyll sometimes have extra options
available.

=== Redcarpet

Redcarpet can be configured by providing an `extensions` sub-setting, whose
value should be an array of strings. Each string should be the name of one of
the `Redcarpet::Markdown` class's extensions; if present in the array, it will
set the corresponding extension to `true`.

Jekyll handles two special Redcarpet extensions:

- `no&#x5F;fenced&#x5F;code&#x5F;blocks` --- By default, Jekyll sets the
`fenced&#x5F;code&#x5F;blocks` extension (for delimiting code blocks with
triple tildes or triple backticks) to `true`, probably because GitHub's eager
adoption of them is starting to make them inescapable. Redcarpet's normal
`fenced&#x5F;code&#x5F;blocks` extension is inert when used with Jekyll;
instead, you can use this inverted version of the extension for disabling
fenced code.

Note that you can also specify a language for highlighting after the first
delimiter:

[source, ruby]
--------------
  # ...ruby code
--------------

With both fenced code blocks and highlighter enabled, this will statically
highlight the code; without any syntax highlighter, it will add a
`class="LANGUAGE"` attribute to the `<code>` element, which can be used as a
hint by various JavaScript code highlighting libraries.

- `smart` --- This pseudo-extension turns on SmartyPants, which converts
  straight quotes to curly quotes and runs of hyphens to em (`---`) and en (`--`) dashes.

All other extensions retain their usual names from Redcarpet, and no renderer
options aside from `smart` can be specified in Jekyll. [A list of available
extensions can be found in the Redcarpet README file.][redcarpet&#x5F;extensions]
Make sure you're looking at the README for the right version of
Redcarpet: Jekyll currently uses v3.2.x. The most commonly used
extensions are:

- `tables`
- `no&#x5F;intra&#x5F;emphasis`
- `autolink`

[redcarpet&#x5F;extensions]: https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/blob/v3.2.2/README.markdown#and-its-like-really-simple-to-use

### Custom Markdown Processors

If you're interested in creating a custom markdown processor, you're in luck! Create a new class in the `Jekyll::Converters::Markdown` namespace:

[source, ruby]
--------------
  class Jekyll::Converters::Markdown::MyCustomProcessor
    def initialize(config)
      require 'funky&#x5F;markdown'
      @config = config
    rescue LoadError
      STDERR.puts 'You are missing a library required for Markdown. Please run:'
      STDERR.puts '  $ [sudo] gem install funky&#x5F;markdown'
      raise FatalException.new("Missing dependency: funky&#x5F;markdown")
    end

    def convert(content)
      ::FunkyMarkdown.new(content).convert
    end
  end
--------------

Once you've created your class and have it properly set up either as a plugin
in the `&#x5F;plugins` folder or as a gem, specify it in your `&#x5F;config.yml`:

[source, yaml]
--------------
  markdown: MyCustomProcessor
--------------

== Incremental Regeneration

Incremental regeneration helps shorten build times by only generating documents
and pages that were updated since the previous build. It does this by keeping
track of both file modification times and inter-document dependencies in the
`.jekyll-metadata` file.

[WARNING]
====
Incremental regeneration is still an experimental feature.

While incremental regeneration will work for the most common cases, it will
not work correctly in every scenario. Please be extremely cautious when
using the feature, and report any problems not listed below by
<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/new">opening an issue on GitHub</a>.
====

Under the current implementation, incremental regeneration will only generate a
document or page if either it, or one of its dependencies, is modified. 
Currently, the only types of dependencies tracked are includes (using the
`{% include %}` tag) and layouts. This means that plain references to other 
documents (for example, the common case of iterating over `site.posts` in a 
post listings page) will not be detected as a dependency.

To remedy some of these shortfalls, putting `regenerate: true` in the 
front-matter of a document will force Jekyll to regenerate it regardless of 
whether it has been modified. Note that this will generate the specified 
document only; references to other documents' contents will not work since 
they won't be re-rendered.

Incremental regeneration can be enabled via the `--incremental` flag (`-i` for
short) from the command-line or by setting `incremental: true` in your
configuration file.
