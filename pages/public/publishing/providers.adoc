A service provider is a vendor that provides IT solutions and/or services to
end users and organizations. A service provider's delivery model generally
differs from conventional IT product manufacturers or developers. Typically,
a service provider does not provide *purchaseing* of an IT product by a user
or organization. Rather then, a service provider *builds*, *operates* and
*manages* IT products, which are bundled and delivered as a *service*.

== Provider

In general, (service) provider are commercial IT companies offering (service)
products to be *paid* for. But most of these comnpanies provide, beside several
commercial business plans, a plan offered to use their platform for *free*
(free plan). Services based on a *free plan* are typically quite limited for
understandable reasons.

A static website based on _Jekyll_ and _J1_ for private use are lightweight.
A private site may have hundreds of pages and assests (like images) but the
overall size of the website seldom execeeds 100M. If the needed software, like
_Ruby_ is counted on top it makes typically less than 250M. Numbers taken from
Heroku logs for a starter web it is about 220M. Luckily, static websites based
on _J1_ are very lightweight and doesn't execeed the critcal limit of *512M*
to use a free plan at any service provider in terms of *size*.

the selected providers can do what you want.
