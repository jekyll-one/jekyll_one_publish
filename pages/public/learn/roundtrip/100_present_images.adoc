Welcome to the first preview page focussing the *image module*. This page shows
you some of the quite useful features of J1 Template to manage your image based
content using lightboxes, carousels (slider) and galleries.

The *image module* offer complex functionality based on powerful open source
libraries like the build-in Gallely *gallery* for simple _Bootstrap_ grid-based
image galleries or *Justified Gallery* for high-end, masonry styled preview
maps. The build-in carousel app *carousel*, using the jQuery plugin *Owl Carousel*
as a base, let you present your images as slide shows.

Lightboxes like *LightGallery* or *Lightbox V2* support your web for full image
views of your *picture* or *video* content. Have a look, a quick tour what J1
can do. Have fun!

== J1 Lightboxes

A *Lightbox* in general is a helper which displays enlarged, almost
screen-filling versions of pictures (or videos), while dimming the rest of the
page. The technique, introduced by Lightbox V2, gained widespread popularity
due to its simple and elegant style. The term *lightbox* is used since then for
Javascript libraries to support such functionality.

For J1 Template, two different lightboxes can be used:

* Lightbox V2 (lightbox)
* LightGallery

The default lightbox used by J1 Template is *Lightbox V2*, a Javascript library
written by _Lokesh Dhakar_. The name of that (build-in) is simply: *lightbox*.
For more complex use cases, like a thumbnail gallery preview or video support,
*LightGallery* can be used alternatively.

NOTE: The name *LightGallery* implies a sort of a Gallery but the library is a
_lightbox_. And, *LightGallery* provides much more functionality on image-based
data rather than enlarged displaying of images. See the examples below to check
for the differences in compare to the more simpler *Lightbox V2* lightbox.

Both lightboxes are fully integrated to be used as standalone modules or to be
used as helpers _under-the-hood_ by other apps or modules focussing on image
data like *gallery* or *carousel*, the build-in carousel module.

=== Lightbox Examples

Find below an example of using the lightbox Lightbox *standalone*. See how
*single* (individual) images are linked for the use with *Lightbox*.

.A Lightbox block for standalone images
lightbox::example-standalone[ 400, {data-images-standalone} ]

For a *group* of images (image sets), *Lightbox* support image *groups*. Click
on the images below to see how *Lightbox* manage image groups.

.A Lightbox block for grouped images
lightbox::example-group[ 400, {data-images-group}, group ]


=== LightGallery Example

*LightGallery* provides more complex functions on image data. The lightbox
supports a gallery-styled thumbnail preview plus image resizing, a dowload
dialog, sharing provider support and some more helpfull. Check what
*LightGallery* can do by the following example.

[subs=attributes]
++++
  <div id="caption1" style="display:none">
    <h4 class="notoc">Image 1</h4><p>Golden Gate Bridge with San Francisco in distance</p>
  </div>
  <div id="caption2" style="display:none">
    <h4 class="notoc">Image 2</h4><p>Forest with mountains behind</p>
  </div>
  <div id="caption3" style="display:none">
    <h4 class="notoc">Image 3</h4><p>Bicyclist looking out over hill at ocean</p>
  </div>

  <div id="lightgallery-roundtrip-example" class="imageblock mb-4" data-sub-html=".caption">
    <a href="{images-dir}/lightbox-image-1.jpg" data-sub-html="#caption1">
      <img src="{images-dir}/lightbox-thumb-1.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge with San Francisco in distance">
    </a>
    <a href="{images-dir}/lightbox-image-2.jpg" data-sub-html="#caption2">
      <img src="{images-dir}/lightbox-thumb-2.jpg" alt="Forest with mountains behind">
    </a>
    <a href="{images-dir}/lightbox-image-3.jpg" data-sub-html="#caption3">
      <img src="{images-dir}/lightbox-thumb-3.jpg" alt="Bicyclist looking out over hill at ocean">
    </a>
  </div>

  <script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $('#lightgallery-roundtrip-example').lightGallery({
          thumbnail: true
      });
    });
  </script>
++++


== J1 Carousel App

*J1 Carousel* is based on *OWL Carousel V1* in the latest (and unfortuneatly
last) version of 1.3.3. OWL Carousel is a clean and neat jQuery slider plugin
for creating fully responsive and touch-enabled carousel sliders.

NOTE: OWL Carousel V1 is *not* longer available on the Internet; for unknown
reason. Anyway, J1 Template is using this version of *OWL Carousel* as a
build-in carousel module because the software does an excellent job, is based
on a MIT license with no issues using them for private and business use.
And offers a lot of great features!

/////
=== Simple Text Carousel

A slider or carousel typically is used for displaying images but the
implementation for J1 Template support a lot more *sources* to be displayed
as a slide show: simple *text* for example.

carousel::owl_demo_text_carousel[role="mb-3"]

Important statements or topics can be placed e.g. on top of an article or a
paragraph to give them a better *visibility*. In one line, you can present
a bunch of *facts* to know animated for the readers attention within as single
line - no much space is needed.

=== Parallax Text Carousel

A more *eye-minded* type of a text show is a *parallax* text slider. If you
want to place emphasis on you personal statements focussing the meaning, this
type of a slide show may be interesting. Image based slide shows may draw off
the readers attention from the text, therefor a *pure text based* presentation
may the better choice.

.Parallax Slider
// carousel::owl_demo_text_carousel_parallax[role="mb-3"]

++++
  <div class="parallax-slider__owl_demo_text_carousel_parallax mb-3" style="background-position: 50% 45px">
    <div id="owl_demo_text_carousel_parallax"></div>
  </div>

 <script>
    $('head').append('<style>.parallax-slider__owl_demo_text_carousel_parallax{background:url(/assets/images/quotes/default.png) 50% 0 repeat fixed}</style>');
    $('head').append('<style>.parallax-slider__owl_demo_text_carousel_parallax{padding:75px 0 75px 25px;position:relative}</style>');
    $('head').append('<style>.parallax-slider__owl_demo_text_carousel_parallax{color:#e5e5e5;font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:400}</style>');
    $('head').append('<!-- style>.parallax-slider__owl_demo_text_carousel_parallax{text-align:center}</style -->');
    $('head').append('<!-- style>.parallax-slider__owl_demo_text_carousel_parallax{text-transform:uppercase}</style -->');
    $('head').append('<style>.parallax-slider__owl_demo_text_carousel_parallax:before{top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;content:" ";position:absolute;background:url(/assets/images/modules/patterns/gridtile.png) repeat;}</style>');
    $('head').append('<style>.parallax-slider__owl_demo_text_carousel_parallax:after{top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;content:" ";position:absolute;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.3)}</style>');
  </script>
++++


Parallax text shows are can be placed as banners on a page. A lot of different
animations can be used. Internally, J1 Template is using some of the really
great CSS styles offered by _animate.css_.

TIP: Have a look a https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/[Dan Eden's home page]
to see all the possible dynamic styles you can create based on pure CSS. *Some*
of them are implemented for *OWL Carousel* for animation. See the documetation
for the *CAROUSEL Module* for more details.
/////

=== Simple Image Carousel

Carousels are mostly used for pictures data to animate the images as series.
Find with the following some examples how to use a carousel for your image
data.

A simple image show is useful for example as an animated (or not animated)
banner presenting interesting things of your site or the products offered.

.Simple Image Carousel
carousel::owl_demo_simple[role="mb-5"]

=== Carousel + Caption + Lightbox

Carousels can be used for a quite compact form of image galleries. This example
show some pictures having individual caption text *and* support a lightbox to
enlarge images full size. For the example below, a quite simple lightbox
is used: *Lightbox V2*; or short: *lightbox*.

.Nice cats
carousel::owl_demo_cats[role="mb-5"]


The J1 module *lightbox* is a simple Lightbox but offers a bunch of interesting
features for displaying images. For example, lightbox can display all images
(of a carousel) as a *group*. If one picture is opened in the lightbox, all
the other can browsed as well.

=== One Slide Carousel + Lightbox

The build-in Carousel *carousel* supports multiple *and* single image shows.
Here you find an example of an single image slide show with *controls* enabled
to browse all images back and forth. An indicator below the slider shows how
many images the show contains.

.Single Slide Carousel and a Lightbox
carousel::owl_demo_oneslide[role="mb-5"]


== J1 Gallery App

To create *image* and *video* galleries, J1 Template implements the jQuery
plugin *JustifiedGallery* as the *main* gallery module. Beside Justified
Gallery, a gallery based on pure _Bootstrap_ code is available with the build-in
gallery app *gallery*.

*Justified Gallery* is a great jQuery plugin to create responsive, infinite
and high quality *justified* image galleries. J1 Template combines the gallery
with the *lightboxes* supported to *enlage* the images of a gallery.

See *Justified Gallery* in action - and for sure all what you see is even
responsive. Change the size of your current browser window, by width or height, 
to see what will happen!

=== Justified Gallery

Pictures you've made are typically *not* even in size. Images may have the
same size (resolution), but some of the are orientated landscape or other
may portrait. For that reason, a more powerful gallery is needed to create
so-called *justified* views.

*Justified Gallery* is using a so-called *masonry grid* layout. It works by
placing elements in an optimal position based on available horizontal and
vertical space. Sort of like mason fitting stones in a wall. You’ll have
seen it in use all over the Internet!
