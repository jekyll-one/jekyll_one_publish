The themes feature for J1 Template is in a *alpha status* of the template
system. Anyway, it makes sense to present what is possible using *different*
versions of Bootstrap's CSS styles for a website.

== Themes

It is expected that many people will change the template for their needs. To
really create *unique* websites. Fundamental to do this is are CSS styles 
defined by Bootstrap.

Modifying the CSS styles of link:{bootstrap-home}[Bootstrap, {window}] is not
rocket science. But, to be honest, some knowledge is needed of 
link:{w3org-css-spec}[the CSS technology] to do so. We encourage you to spend
some time first on learning CSS. To learn what is the 
link:{w3schools-css-tutorial}[design base, {window}] of each and every website. 
Independendly from using Bootstrap or any other CSS framwork.

Thanks to the people at link:{bootswatch-home}[Bootswatch, {window}], a great 
set of already prepared Bootstrap stylesheets in various designs are available 
at their website. No need to start from the scratch, to re-define all the 
Bootstrap variables and rebuilt the framework files to create a new theme. Many
different styles are available. What is already available is at least a good 
base for your modifications: your unique design.

Beside the bunch of different stylesheets at Bootswatch, an 
link:{bootswatch-api}[integration API, {window}] is available that helps a lot
to integrate available designs into a existing site. This API is the base to 
integrate Bootswatch stylesheets into J1 Template for easy use.

Thanks again the people at Bootswatch for this great work.


== Apply a theme

The base for designing pages using J1 Template is the theme *Uno*, a modern 
light theme that can be used for many types of websites. And what we mentioned
already, web design is not: one size fits all. The theme *Uno* can be seen as
good base, a starting point. Combining Uno and a different theme may a fast
solution for your site!?

You can find all available themes, all stylesheets to be applied to your pages 
from the menu *Themes*. You're invited to check how a page is changing for 
their design if other stylesheets, other ideas of web design is used. 

NOTE: Changing BS-based styles is one thing, changing from one theme to the 
next at runtime a bit more challanging. For the alpha version of J1 Template, 
many styles are automatically changed for J1 specific components as well, but
*not* all of them for now. 

Simply select a theme from this menu and a new BS-based stylesheet is 
automatically applied to your pages.

Have fun!

== Whats next

Hopefully you've enjoyed exploring some of the possibilities J1 offers for
managing themes. But much, much more can the J1 do for your website.

This was the last place to go for the roundtrip. More details of the most
common elements of Bootstrap can be found on the previewer for a theme. Have
a look at the link:{previewer-theme}[Theme previewer].

To make things real for your new site, go for *Web in a day*. This tutorial
guides you through all the steps how to build a website - your site using
Jekyll  nd the template system J1. It's really a nice journey to *explore* 
and  *learn* creating a static web.
