*Web in a Day* is the first in a series of tutorials to learn how to
create modern websites using Jekyll. This Kickstarter focuses on the basics
of Jekyll and the J1 Template, which all people needs to know for a successful
way to a modern static website using Jekyll and J1 Template.

It is highly recommended to read and work on this tutorial by everyone -
independently from what level of knowledge they begin. Jekyll is from classic
Content Management Systems (CMS) like Joomla, WordPress or Drupal.
No surprise: Jekyll and J1 are different as well.

It sounds much, spending a whole day to get Jekyll to know - yes, it is much.
You'll find a lot of Blog articles like *Jekyll in 15 minutes*. But what can
be *learned* in 15 minutes?

To be fair, most of these blogs are intended to help *installing Jekyll* and
get the very first steps managed out of the box. If you run Jekyll out of the
box, the resulting website (from the build-in theme scaffold) might somewhat
frustrating. You'll get an elementary site created based on Jekyll's theme
*minima*.

To not waste time, get through the tutorial and find out what is the
*Jekyll Way*. And if this the way you want to go.

Have a good time, a good day learning Jekyll.
