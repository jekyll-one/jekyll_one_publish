See: https://documentation.help/LogExpert/Welcome.htm[documentation.help, window="_blank"]

LogExpert is a tool for real time log file displaying (also known as _tail_)
as well as for analyzing log files _offline_.

A summary of features comes here:

* MDI-Interface with Tabs
* Search function (including RegEx), Goto line
* Bookmarks with comments
* A very flexible filter view
* Highlighting lines via search criteria
* Splitting log lines into columns for some logfile formats
* Parse the timestamp of every log line
* Navigation in the log file via timestamps
* Timeshift: Add/sub an offset to all displayed date/time values
* Launch external tools - passing aruments to the tools
* 3rd party plugin API for Columnizers, context menus, keyword triggers
* Support for Log4j XML files


== File handling

=== Loading files

Files can be loaded in 3 different ways:

* Passing the filenames as command line arguments when starting
* Using the _Open..._ item in the File menu or the Icon
* Drag _n_ Drop the files onto LogExpert

LogExpert loads the complete file because it has to count the number of
lines. If the file is very large LogExpert will purge unused lines out
of the memory. If the purged lines are requested again (e.g. by
scrolling through the log file), LogExpert will reload the content.

=== Watching files

Every open file is watched for size modifications (the file is polled in
250 ms interval). As soon as the file size grows up, the new lines will
be read. If the file size decreases (e.g. if the file is created anew),
LogExpert starts to load the complete file again. If you use the
MultiFile feature, this behaviour is slightly different. See MultiFile
chapter for more informations.

If the _Follow tail_ checkbox is checked, LogExpert will always show
the new content by scrolling to the end of the logfile.

An activity level meter will show you how frequent the logfile is
changed.

The small LED on the right of the activity meter is the _dirty LED_.
This LED lits up when a log file content has changed and the tab window
of the log file is not the active tab. It also lits up on the active tab
if the log file content has changed and the Follow tail mode is
switched off.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_001.png[image,width=305,height=141]

=== Follow tail state

In the settings there_s an option on the first page ("View settings)
called "Show tail state on tabs". If this option is enabled, there_s an
additional LED on every tab. This LED lits up when Follow tail is
active. The color can be choosen in the settings.

If Follow tail is switched off by a keyword trigger (Highlighting and
triggers), the LED lits yellow.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_002.png[image,width=296,height=142]

=== If a file is missed

If an open file does not exist or is deleted while watching, LogExpert
will try to re-open it for some seconds. If the file is still missed,
LogExpert clears the window and displays an appropriate icon on the tab.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_003.png[image,width=403,height=204]

LogExpert keeps watching for the file as long as the tab window is open.
If the file appears again, it will be reloaded.

=== Reloading files manually

You can always press the F5 key to reload a file manually.

=== Renaming tabs

Double click a tab to rename it. Tab names will be saved in the
persistence files.



=== Search

Choose _Search_ from the View/Navigate menu or Press Ctrl-F to open the
search dialog.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_004.png[]

Simply enter your search item and press Enter (or click OK) to start the
search. If the search item is found, the line containing the item is
selected. If not, a _not found_ message is displayed on the status line.

After an item was found you can can use the F3 key to locate the next
search hit. If the end of the file is reached, the search starts from
the top. Use Shift-F3 to reverse the search direction.

You can also use regular expressions by selecting the "Regular
Expression" option.

=== Locating a line

_Go to line_ from the View/Navigate menu (Ctrl-G) opens a simple dialog
where you can enter a line number. Use this if you want to jump to a
specific line.

=== Normal navigation

Use the scrollbar or mouse wheel to navigate through the file. If you
scroll to the

end, the _Follow tail_ checkbox will be enabled automatically. If you
scroll upwards the checkbox is disabled.

You can also use the usually keyboard commands for navigation:


[cols="4,8", options="header", role="table-responsive"]
|===============================================================================
|Key |Description

|Arrow up/down
|One line up or down

|Ctrl + Arrow up/downCtrl + Home/End
|Jump to start/end of the logfile

|PgUp/PgDown
|Scroll one page up or down

|Alt + PgUp/PgDown
|Jump to prev/next highlight entry

|===============================================================================


=== Adding blank lines

By pressing the Enter key you can double the height of the current line.
This looks like a blank line. You can use this to get a better overview
in logs or to group some lines. To remove a blank line use the Backspace
key.

The blank lines will be saved in the persistence file. So make shure
you have persistence enabled in the settings.



== Filter

The filter is a powerful feature of LogExpert. You should read the
filter chapters to get all the ideas behind the filter feature.

=== Simple filtering

Choose _Filter_ from the View/Navigate menu to open the filter panel. On
top of the panel you see the input area. Below the input area you see
the filter result list.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_005.png[]

Enter a search item and press Enter (or click the Search button). The
result list will display all lines with a search hit. You can double
click a line in the result list to locate this line in the main logfile
view.

If you cange any of the filter options or enter a new search term, a red
_dirty_ indicator on the search button will show you that the filter
result list doesn_t match the current filter settings:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_006.png[]

==== Filter tail

This option has the same function as the _Follow tail_ checkbox, but
only for the filter result list. So the result list is always
up-to-date, if the log file changes.

==== Sync

This options will sync the position in the filter result list to the
position of the log file display. If you scroll through the content of
the log file in the upper list, the filter view will synchronize its
position.

=== RegEx

Use regular expressions in the search string.

=== Advanced Filter functions

By clicking the _Show advanced_ button you will see more interesting
features of

LogExpert_s filter.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_007.png[]

By clicking the _Hide advanced_ button you can close the Pro-Panel. Even
if closed, the advanced options are active of course. There_s a small
red indicator

on the button if you have set any of the advanced options but the panel
is closed:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_008.png[]

==== Range search

Enable _Range search_ and enter a second search item in the input field.
Now the filter acts somewhat different. It searches for the first item.
If found, the line with the search hit and all following lines will be
added to the result list, until the second search item is found.

This can be useful to filter out content with defined start and end tags
(like

<html> </html>).

==== Back Spread

Click on the knob and drag your mouse up and down to change the value.
If you set a value other than zero the filter result list contains not
only the lines with a search hit. It also contains the adjusted number
of lines beneath the search hit in backward direction.

Example: You set back spread to a value of 3 and search for "mouse". If
"mouse" is found on line 200 of your log file, the lines 199, 198 and
197 will be added to the result list, too.

To distinguish between the real search hit lines and the spread lines,
the search hit lines will be colored with gray background.

==== Fore Spread

Same as Back Spread but in forward direction.

==== Fuzzyness

(Experimental) This will use the Damerau-Levenshtein-Distance algorithm
to add some fuzzyness to the search. The knob adjusts the fuzzyness
factor. 0 means off (exact matches only). Depending on the search items
the results may be unexpected and not very useful.

==== Filter to Tab

This button will open a new tab window and display the whole content of
the filter result list in the new tab. But that_s not all: The new tab
window will watch for log file modifications and keep its content
up-to-date (like the _filter tail_ feature). You can launch as many
filter tab windows as you want. Every filter tab window will keep its
own search criteria.

Note that you have to click the search button (or to press Enter) before
you launch a new filter tab window.

==== Invert Match

If checked, the filter results contains all lines that does *not* match
the search term.

Note that the invert match operates before the Spread settings. The
order is:

. Check for matching lines
. Invert results
. Add additional lines regarding to the Spread settings

==== Column restrict

If checked, the filter will search only in the columns you enabled in
the Columns dialog (click on the "Columns" button to open the Columns
dialog). The

columns are provided by the currently selected Columnizer. So be sure
you have

selected the right one. If more than one column is checked, the filter
uses a kind of OR logic: A line matches if one of the columns contains
the search string.

.Options in the Column dialog
image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_009.png[]

==== Exact match

If checked, the filter matches only if the search string equals exactly
the column content. If not checked, a substring search is performed.

==== On empty columns

Choose the behaviour for empty columns

[cols="",]
|===============================================================================

a|No hit An empty column is no search hit.
a|Search hit An empty column is always a search hit.
a|Use prev content
a|The column is a search hit if the last non- empty column was a search
hit. This is usefull for multi line content like stack traces or data
dumps.

|===============================================================================


==== Column restrict Example

Here_s an example for the "Use prev content" option. The filter is set
up to search for the string "3156" in the column Thread. As you can
see, the multi line XML dump is contained completely in the filter
result even though the thread id we_re looking for is found only on the
first line of the dump.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_010.png[]

*Context menu in filter result list*

The filter result list has its own context menu. Here you can - for
example - set a bookmark for all selected filter results.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_011.png[]

*Hints and tips for using the filter*

The filter function can be a very powerful feature if used in the right
way. So be creative in using the filter for your daily work with
logfiles! Here are some hints and use cases you might be interested in.

*Use a filter on filter tabs*

A filter tab window is like a normal logfile window. That means you can
use a filter on that window. So you can filter an already filtered
content - it_s like a filter chain. In combination with the Back Spread
and Fore Spread settings you can find issues in your logfiles that would
be hard to find with traditional search functions.

Example:

Your customer says: "Sometimes I get an error message when using the
function

_PlaySound_ in your software". There are no date or time for you to
narrow the search. All you have is 15 MBs of logfiles and that improper
error message of your customer. The word "error" appears often in the
logfile (because it sometimes reflects a normal user error situation).
The word "PlaySound" appears very often too (in a non-error context).
How to find the sporadic error when

using the function "PlaySound"?

* Use the filter to search for "PlaySound".
* Before doing the search, adjust the _Fore Spread_ to a value that is
  usefull to include some log messages around the "PlaySound" log entry.
  Use _Back Spread_ too, if needed.
* Use _Filter to tab_ to see the filter results in a new tab window.
* Use a new filter on the new tab and search for the word "error"

Now you have all "error" log messages that appear in the near of the

"PlaySound" messages.

*The range search*

Range search is useful for logfile content that is marked by some kind
of start and end items (e.g. all kinds of XML tags).

Example:

You have an application that writes XML to some kind of external
interface. For diagnostic reasons the output is also written to the
logfile:

<output>

...some content...

</output>

If you are interested only in the output XML content you can use the
range search in the filter. Use "<output>" as first search item and
"</output>" as second search item (enable "Range search" in the advanced
filter view). The filter result will include all the lines from
"<output>" to "</output>".

*Locate line in original file*

There_s an menu item called _Locate filtered line in original file_ in
the context menu of every filter tab. When you choose this item you can
quickly jump to the appropriate position in your original file tab.

*Save and restore filter settings*

On the right of the filter result list there_s a small button which
toggles a list. In this list you can save filter settings.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_012.png[]

With the "Save Filter" button you can add the current filter settings to
the list. So can recall the filter when you need it later by
double-clicking an entry.

The state of the list (hidden/visible) is stored in the persistence
settings of each log file.

*Auto start*

If the "Auto start" option is checked, the filter search will start
immediately when the filter is restored.

This is a global option which is saved in the settings of LogExpert.

*Auto hide*

If the "Auto hide" option is checked, the list with the saved filters
will be hidden after loading a filter setting from the list.

This is a global option which is saved in the settings of LogExpert.

*Change color*

By right-clicking an entry you can change the color of the entry in the
list. This doesn_t affect the filtering in any way. But it_s useful for
a better overview when

your filter list has many entries:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_013.png[]



== Columnizers

A columnizer can split the logfile into well defined columns. So a
columnizer must know the format of the logfile. Because there are many
different logfile formats out there, LogExpert cannot handle all of
them. But you can provide your own columnizer by writing a plugin.

To select a columnizer for the current log file Choose "Columnizer" from
the Options menu.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_014.png[]

If you check the "Apply to all open files" option, the selected
columnizer will be applied to all open log files.

LogExpert stores a history of log files and its selected columnizers. So
when you load a file again, the last selected columnizer is enabled
automatically.

The Config button is only enabled if the Columnizer provides an own
configuration dialog. The columnizers shipped with LogExpert don_t have
configuration dialogs.

=== Timeshift support

A columnizer can optionally support timeshift. That means that the
columnizer is capable of parsing the date/time values of a line in the
logfile. The columnizer can add an offset to the displayed date/time
value. Timeshift support is needed for the so called Timeshift feature and
for navigating via date/time control.

=== Built-in Columnizers

There are 4 built-in columnizers. 3 of them support Timeshift.

==== Timestamp

This columnizer splits the line into 3 fields: date, time and the rest
of the log message. The columnizer expects a date at position 0 of the
line followed by a time (separated by space).

Following formats are recognized:

dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss.fff

dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss,fff

dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss

yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.fff

yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss,fff

yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss

yyyy.MM.dd HH:mm:ss.fff

yyyy.MM.dd HH:mm:ss,fff

yyyy.MM.dd HH:mm:ss

yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss

yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff

yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,fff

dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss

dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss.fff

dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss,fff

dd.MM.yy HH:mm:ss.fff

yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss:ffff

Here you can see an example. The first screenshot shows the original log
file content (as shown when using no columnizer). The second screenshot
shows the same log file using the Timestamp columnizer.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_015.png[]

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_016.png[]

==== CLF

This columnizer expects lines to be formatted according the the CLF
(Common logfile format) used by many web servers.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_017.png[]

==== CSV

The CSV Columnizer splits files with comma separated fields into
columns. The number of columns is determined from the file content.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_018.png[]

You can configure the Columnizer by clicking the Config-Button on the
Columnizer-Chooser dialog.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_019.png[]

[cols="4,8", options="header", role="table-responsive"]
|===============================================================================
|Key |Description

|`Delimiter char`
|The character which separates the fields. In most CSV files this will be
comma or semicolon. Excel uses a semicolon.

|`Quote char`
|The character which is used to quote fields, so it can contain delimiter
chars in its content. Excel uses " (at least in the german version)

|`Escape char`
|Character letting insert quotation characters inside a quoted field.
Excel uses " (at least in the german version)

|`Comment char`
|When a line starts with this character, its treated as non-existing

|`First line contains names`
|Check this option, if the first line in the file contains the names of
the fields. The columns in LogExpert will be named like this field
names. Also the first line isn_t displayed as file content.

|===============================================================================


==== Log4j XML

The Log4j XML Columnizer will parse log files produced by log4j when
using XMLLayout. In XMLLayout every log entry is packed in a XML
structure like this:

.XMLLayout
[source, xml, role="noclip"]
----
<log4j:message>
  <![CDATA[This is log message number 0]]>
</log4j:message>

<log4j:locationInfo class="de.har.log4jtest.Main" 
method="main" file="Main.java" line="28"/>

</log4j:event>
----

The Columnizer can parse this XML structures and will display the log
entries in a human readable way just like normal text log files:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_020.png[]

In the Columnizer configuration you can select the field to display and
the maximum length.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_021.png[]

The Log4j XMl Columnizer source code is provided the LogExpert SDK. You
can use it as a starting point to create XML Columnizers for other log
file formats.


=== Custom Columnizer

You can create your own columnizer and use them with LogExpert.

Have a look at
http://www.log-expert.de/sdk.html[www.log-expert.de/sdk.html.] There
you can find instructions on how to build your own columnizers and some
example code.

Short summary:

. You have to provide a DLL written in some .NET language.
. You have to implement the ILogLineColumnizer interface exported by
  the ColumnizerLib DLL.
. Put the DLL into a subdirectory of LogExpert called _plugins_


== Timeshift and timestamp driven navigation

If the currently used columnizer supports timeshift you can be lucky.
Because this gives you some extra features described here.

=== Timeshift

Timeshift means that you can add an offset to the displayed date and
times values. This is useful if you have to work with logfiles of
clients and servers with differing system clocks.

If the columnizer supports timeshift you can enable the timeshift
feature in ther View/Navigate menu.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_022.png[]

You can enter a time offset in the format HH:mm:ss.fff (fff =
milliseconds). If you don_t want to calculate the needed offset by
yourself you can also doubleclick in a log line into the column that
displays the date/time.

Now you are in the edit mode. Simply enter the time you want to see for this log
entry and press Enter. The columnizer handles the time parsing and will
calculate the needed offset.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_023.png[]

=== Timestamp navigation

If the columnizer supports timeshift there_s a date/time control at the
status line of LogExpert. If you cannot see the control even if the
columnizer supports timeshift, check the settings dialog. Maybe the
timestamp control is disabled.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_024.png[]

The timestamp control shows the timestamp of the current selected line.
The displayed format is always "dd.MM.yyyy HH.mm.ss".

You can change every digit by clicking with the left mouse button and
dragging up/down or left/right. The drag direction (horizontal or
vertical) can be changed via context menu or in the global settings
dialog.

After releasing the mouse button LogExpert tries to find the first
logfile entry that matches the selected timestamp. It doesn_t matter if
no exact match ist found. LogExpert will select the line right before
the selected time, if no exact match can be located.

==== Scroll to timestamp

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_025.png[]

In the context menu there_s an item _Scroll all tabs to current
timestamp_. When you select this item all open logfiles will scroll to
the timestamp of the selected line. Of course this works only for files
with a selected columnizer that supports timeshift.

==== Determine timestamp difference

If you select 2 lines in the log file display, the time difference
between the 2 selected lines will be displayed in the status line. No
need to calculate that boring time diffs by yourself anymore!

=== Time spread view

Time spread view can give you an fast overview about the timestamps in
your logfile. See Time spread view for more information.

The time spread view can give you a fast overview about your logfile
when you_re interested in the timestamps of the log entries. You can see
where the most "activity" can be found in the log. "Activity" means:
"How many lines can be found in a specific time span?".

Time spread view works only when a Columnizer with Timeshift support is
selected.

Have a look at this screenshot. On the right you can see some markers
(small ines). Positions with lines means that there is more activity in
the log.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_026.png[]

There are 2 different display modes which you can select in the
settings. Choose the one you like best.

*Activating the Time spread display*

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_027.png[]

You have to activate the Time spread display in the settings. If
activated, the display appears on the right side of the scrollbar. You
can change the contrast of the display by right-clicking on the display
and dragging the mouse up and down.

There_s a low-prio background task which recomputes the display on the
following events:

* The window size has changed (this includes opening/closing filter or
  bookmark window)
* The log file content has changed and there_s no log activity since 2
  seconds

*Time mode*

In time mode LogExpert will determine the time range of the whole log
file. Then it uses the line count to compute an average lines-per-_time
unit_ value. The

_time unit_ is a time range which depends on the time range of the log
file and the height of the log view window. In fact it is computed as
_log file time range_ / _window height_. Now for every time unit the
real number of lines in this unit will be counted. The more this value lies
above the average value, the more the marker for this time unit is visible
(by using alpha blending).

In short words: A marker indicates a time range which contains more log
lines than usual in this log (= more activity).

The visible result depends on the log file. If you have continuously
traffic in the file with some peaks (e.g. in a web server log), you
should see the peaks in the time spread display.

The time spread view can be used as an easy timestamp based navigation
tool. If you click on the time spread view, LogExpert will navigate your
log file to the timestamp you selected on the time spread view. This can
help to find a position in the file if you know the approx time.

Note that the display does not represent the range of lines in the file.
It represents the time range. If you click in the middle of the display,
LogExpert will locate to a timestamp in the middle of the whole time
range. That_s not the middle of the log file in most cases.

*Line mode*

The line mode is vice versa. It computes a _line unit_ value (line count
/ window height). Now for every _line unit_ it computes the time range.
If this range is higher than the average time range, a marker will be
drawn on the time spread display.

In line mode a marker indicates that more time than usual has passed by
in a specific section of the log file. That means a marker shows
locations in which the log has "paused" for a while. Thats quite the
opposite to the time mode.

Note that in line mode the display does not represent the whole range of
time (as in time mode) but the whole range of lines. So if you click in
the middle of the display, the middle of the log file is located.

*Time sync*

Ever needed to scroll through 2 or more logfiles side by side just to
keep the timestamp positions in sync? LogExpert can do this for you. All
you need is a Columnizer that supports timestamp parsing and logfiles
with proper timestamps (every good logfile should have timestamps). Now
you can keep 2 or more file tabs in sync, if you want to.

"In sync" means: As soon as you change the current line in one of the
synced files, all other files will re-locate its current position to the
same timestamp. This works in all directions. There_s no kind of master
or slave. If you scroll in one file, all synced files will follow.

*How to sync*

Just select the "Time synced files" menu entry from the context menu.
You will see all other tab names in the sub-menu:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_028.png[]

Files without timestamp Columnizers will be drawn disabled. All other
files can be selected. When selected, the files will be in sync.

You can have various files synced independently. So there can be
multiple "groups" of synced files which doesn_t affect each other. In
the context menu you can see if a file is already synced to another
file:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_029.png[]

Look at the screenshot above. The blue entries are 2 files which are
already synced. Not to your current file but to another. You can join to
an existing synced group by selecting one of the blue entries.

Synced files can be spotted by the orange LED on the tab:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_030.png[]


*Scroll behaviour when start syncing*

If you select a file for syncing which is currently not synced, then the
selected file (i.e. the _other_ file) will relocate to the timestamp of
the current file.

If you select a file which is already synced (i.e. _join a group_ - the
blue entries...you remember), then the current file will relocate to the
timestamp position of the already existing sync group.


*Disable syncing*

You can release a file from the sync mode via contenxt menu. Just select
"Free this window from time sync"



== MultiFile

Most log file producing applications have a mechanism called "logfile
rolling" or something like that. That means, if the logfile (e.g.
logfile.txt) reaches a pre- defined file size, it will be renamed to
logfile.txt.1 and a new logfile.txt will be created. If logfile.txt.1
already exists, it will be renamed to logfile.txt.2 and so on up to a
pre-defined number of files. So you maybe have a history of logfiles
with logfile.txt.9 (containing the oldest log entries), logfile.txt.8,
logfile.txt.7 and so

on up to to logfile.txt with the most recent log entries. The 9 ist only
an example. It can be any number.

LogExpert can handle all this logfiles like one single large logfile.
You you don_t have to worry about, in which logfile you have to search
something. It_s like working with a single file.

=== Using MultiFile

For using MultiFile your files should follow the naming rule. That means
if your most recent logfile is named "logfile.txt", the second most
recent file must have the name "logfile.txt.1". The more less recent
logfile is called "logfile.txt.2", and so on.

To enable MultiFile load the most recent logfile (e.g. logfile.txt) into
LogExpert. Now choose _MultiFile_ from the File menu. LogExpert will now
load all files following the naming rule for the currently loaded file.
LogExpert tries to load files by adding the numbers 1, 2, 3... to the
file name and stops as soon as a file with the resulting filename isn_t
found.

=== Navigate MultiFiles

You can use all functions and all navigations in a loaded MultiFile.
There_s no difference to a normal file. When using MultiFile you can see
the real filename of your current position in the status line. By using
the Alt-Up and Alt-Down keys you can jump to the file boundaries.

The displayed line count is the sum of all lines in all loaded files.
The file size display shows the file size of the most current file.

==== Rollover

If the application that produces your logfiles does a rollover (i.e.
renaming all files by shifting the filenames) Logexpert will detect this
situation. All internal file buffers will be shifted according to the
new file names. If the oldest logfile gets lost (because your
application reaches the logfile history limit) its content will be
removed from the display.

==== Behind the scenes

Just in case you_re interested, here is how LogExpert handles the log
files if MultiFile is enabled:

Imagine 3 logfiles: logfile.txt.2, logfile.txt.1 and logfile.txt.
logfile.txt is the most current log file. It_s the primary log file,
feed by your application with new log entries.

Now you load logfile.txt and enable MultiFile. LogExpert will look for a
file called "logfile.txt.1" and load it. Then it looks for
"logfile.txt.2" and load it. Then it looks for "logfile.txt.3", does not
find it and stop looking for more logfiles. All 3 log files will be
displayed seamlessly in one window. LogExpert will watch "logfile.txt"
for modifications and add the new log entries to the log window.

If logfile.txt reaches the size limit, your application starts to do a
log file rollover:

*File renamed to*

logfile.txt.2 logfile.txt.3

logfile.txt.1 logfile.txt.2

logfile.txt logfile.txt.1

<created a new> logfile.txt

LogExpert will detect that logfile.txt is created a new (because of the
smaller file size). It checks, if there_s a file logfile.txt.3 and if
so, it checks if logfile.txt.3 has the same file size as logfile.txt.2
had before. If this is true, it will be assumed that logfile.txt.3 is
the same file previously known as logfile.txt.2. The same procedure is
done with logfile.txt.2 and logfile.txt.1.

Because the files are the same as before (but only with other names)
there is no need to reload all files again. Only some internal file
infos have to be adjusted (file buffers, bookmarks, filter search
results etc.). The new created logfile.txt is loaded completely, of
course. LogExpert will also start to load the old files completely, as
soon as it cannot match the new files with the old ones. In most cases
this will be logfile.txt.1, because it may contain content that was not
read before by LogExpert.

Most applications have a limit for the logfile history. If (in our the
example) the limit would be 4, there_s no logfile.txt.4. The content of
logfile.txt.3 will be lost, when a rollover occurs.

LogExpert can handle this situation. If LogExpert cannot find a renamed
file for the oldest log file, its content will be removed from the
internal file buffers (and from the log file display). This will almost
result in changed line numbers. But all bookmarks and filter results
will be adjusted. Bookmarks and filter results that are invalid now
(because of the deleted log file) will be removed.



== Bookmarks

You can set bookmarks for marking positions in the log file. Use the
following keyboard shortcuts:


[cols="4,8", options="header", role="table-responsive"]
|===============================================================================
|Key |Description

|F2
|Jump to next boomark

|Shift-F2
|Jump to previous bookmark

|Ctrl-F2
|Toggle (set/unset) bookmark at current line

|Alt-F2
|Edit bookmark comment at current line

|F6
|Show/Hide bookmark list

|===============================================================================


By pressing the F6 key you can get a list of all current bookmarks. In
the bookmark list you can jump to a bookmark (double click or Enter).
You can also delete one or more bookmarks using the context menu or by
pressing the delete key in the bookmark list.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_031.png[]

=== Bookmark comments

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_032.png[]

You can add a comment to every bookmark. This can be done in 2 ways:
Edit the comment in the text field in the bookmark list or press Alt-F2
in the log file view.

If the "Show bookmark bubbles" option in the toolbar is checked, the
comments will be shown as an half-transparent overlay on the log file.
If you don_t like the default position, you can drag every bubble to
another position.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_033.png[]

In the bookmark list you can see all the bookmark comments when enabling
the

"Show comment column" switch:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_034.png[]

*Note:*

The bookmarks (and their comments) are saved in the persistence file.
If you

don_t have enabled persistence in the settings your bookmarks will get
lost on file closing.



== Highlighting

You can set up a list of keywords that will mark lines in the log file
in different colors. Every time a keyword is found, the whole line will
be colored as configured in the Highlight settings.

Choose "Hilighting and triggers" from the Options menu to see the
following dialog:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_035.png[]

*Adding an entry*

Enter a search string into the input field and choose a color for
foreground and background. Then click on the "Add" button.

*Removing an entry*

Select the entry to be removed from the list. Then click on the "Delete"
button.

*Changing an entry*

Select the entry to be changed from the list. Now you can change the
search text and/or colors etc. As soon as you change something, the
"Apply" button will be enabled. Click on the "Apply" button to commit
your changes.

*Entry order*

You can change the order of the entries by using the "Up" and "Down"
buttons. LogExpert will check the entries from top to bottom. As soon as
a keyword matches a log line, the settings for this entry will be
applied (the log line gets colored). If more keywords would match for
the line, only the first wins.

*Action triggers*

There are also 4 "actions" that can be triggered by keywords:

Don't lit dirty LED

Lines containing the keyword will not lit the LED that indicates a "dirty"
log file state.

Useful for "unimportant" periodical log messages (connection pools, timing messages etc.)
A bookmark will automatically be set on the line containing the keyword.

You can enter a comment for this bookmark. In the bookmark comment you
can use the following variables:

%L = line number

%P =directory path to file

Set bookmark %N = file name

%F = complete path incl. name

%E = file extension

%M = file name without extension

\{<regex>} \{<replace>} Regex-Search/Replace operation will be done on
the content of the current selected line.

Stop Follow

Tail

"Follow Tail" will be switched off as soon as the keyword is found on a
line. This can be usefull to let LogExpert stop scrolling when something
important is happening in the logfile.

Plugin Launch a plugin. You can use built-in plugins or write your own
plugin using the SDK.

Note that the action triggers only work for new "incoming" log file
content. In other words, the conditions for the actions triggers are
only checked when a log file has been changed and only for the new
appended lines.

== Grouping

You can create various sets of highlight settings. A set of highlight
settings is called a "group". You can choose the current group with the
combo box in the toolbar:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_036.png[]

Only the active group will be in effect. This allows fast switching of
the file coloring depending on current needs or file types. You can also
assign highlight groups for file types (via name pattern matching) in
the settings.

Hint: Right-clicking the combo box will open the highlight settings.


== External tools

You can configure 3 external tools which can be launched from LogExpert.
LogExpert can add some command line arguments (file name, line number
etc.). The output of a tool (stdout) can be piped to a new tab window in
LogExpert.

=== Setting up the tools

Choose "Settings..." from the options menu and click on the "External
Tools" tab in the setting dialog. Or choose "Configure..." from the
tools menu.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_037.png[]

Here you can configure as many tools as you like. All the tools will
appear in the

Tools menu. Checked entries will also be available in the tool bar.

*Name*

The name that will used in the Tools menu and for tool bar tooltips.

*Program*

Enter the path to the executable to be lauched here or click the button
on the right for opening a file chooser dialog.

*Arguments*

Here you can type in the arguments for the command line of the lauched
executable. You can use the following variables which will be replaced
by its values when launching the tool:


[cols="4,8", options="header", role="table-responsive"]
|===============================================================================
|Argument |Description

|`%L`
|Current line number. This is the number of the currently selected line
in the log window.

|`%N`
|Name of log file without path

|`%P`
|Directory of log file

|`%F`
|Full file name (incl. path) of the log file

|`%E`
|File name extension of the log file

|`%M`
|Name of log file without extension

|`?"<param-name>"(def1,def2,...)`
|A parameter value that will be asked for on every tool launch. The
optional param-name is only used for the parameter requester dialog. You
can provide a list of pre-defined values (optional) which will be
accessible in the requester dialog via combo box.

|`\{<regex>} \{<replace>}`
|A Regex-Search/Replace operation will be done on the content of the
current selected line. The result is added to the command line.

|===============================================================================


If you use the MultiFile feature, the log file name is always the
correct name of the file which contains the currently selected line.
(remember that MultiFile treats 2 or more files like a single
concatenated file). The line number will also be corrected.

The curly braces used as the regex markers will be removed and are not
part of the regex. Curly braces used in regex itself will not be removed
of course. Only the outer braces will be removed.

*Pipe sysout to tab*

If this option is checked, LogExpert will redirect all output (stdout)
of the external tool to a tab window (a new tab will be opened).

*Columnizer for output*

Here you can select a Columnizer which will be used for the output
tab. Only available if "Pipe sysout to tab" is enabled.

*Icon button*

You can choose any icon that you like. The icon doesn_t need to be in
the executable for the tool. It can be in any other executable, dll or
icon file.

*Tool Arguments Help*

You can use the button on the right of the argument input field to show
a helper dialog. In this dialog you see a summary of all the variables
described above. Edit the argument line and click on the "Test" button
to see the result. You see the result as it would be given as the
argument line to the lauched tool.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_038.png[]

*Regex-Example:*

Regex is useful to parse compiler output an find the file name and line
numbers. Imagine the following line in the build log of a C++ compiler:

c:\work\listplugsample\listplug.cpp(155) : warning C4996: _stricmp_ was
declared deprecated

You can use the following 2 regex/replace-expressions to parse out file
name and

line number from the compiler output

File name \{(.*)\(.*}\{$1}

Line number \{.*\((\d*)\).*}\{$1}

You can use both expressions on the argument line to start an editor
with file name and line number. The argument line for UltraEdit in this
example would be:

\{(.*)\(.*}\{$1}/\{.*\((\d*)\).*}\{$1} (File name, slash, line number)



*Context menu*

Some functions are only available via context menu (right mouse click in
the log view).

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_039.png[]

*Copy to clipboard*

Copies the selected lines or cells into the system clipboard. Choose
"Cell select mode" in the Options menu to switch between selecting of
single cells or full rows.

*Copy to new tab*

Copies the selected lines or cells into a new tab window. Choose "Cell
select mode" in the Options menu to switch between selecting of single
cells or full rows.

If you copy full rows to a new tab the copied rows will remember its
original position in the original file. You can choose "Locate filtered
line in original file" to jump to the position of the copied line in the
original file.

*Scroll all tabs to current timestamp*

This menu item is only available if a Columnizer that supports
Timeshift is active. By choosing this item, all open tabs will scroll
to the same timestamp like the current selected line. Of course this
works only if the other tabs have a timeshift capable Columnizer
selected.

In some cases there_s no exact match of timestamps beween logfiles.
LogExpert will try to find an exact match. If no exact match is found
the next smaller timestamp is selected.

*Time synced files / free this window from time sync*

This menu items are only available if a Columnizer that supports
Timeshift is active. You can "link" 2 or more tabs together. If you
select a line in one of the linked tabs then all other linked tabs will
scroll to the same timestamp position.

See Time sync for more information about that feature.

*Locate filtered line in original file*

This item is available if the current tab is a filter result tab or a
tab created by "Copy to new tab". By choosing this item you can easily
jump to the position in the file where the selected line comes from.

*Toggle bookmark*

Set or remove a bookmark on the current line.

*Mark/Edit-Mode*

Switch to "edit mode". Because you cannot edit log files with LogExpert
this is only usefull to copy parts of a log line to the clipboard or use
the context menu to filter for the selected search term.

If Timeshift ist enabled you can use the edit mode to "edit" the
timestamp of a log line. The timeshift offset will be calculated from
the entered value. Then the offset will be applied to all log lines.

You can also switch to edit mode by double clicking a line.

Note that the mark/edit mode has its own context menu with useful
functions!

*Temp highlights*

You can remove all temporary highlights or move them to the current
highlight settings. Temporary highlights can be set when selecting parts
of the line (mark/edit mode) and using the context menu.

*Mark current filter range*

This menu entry is only available if you have set up a filter with a
range search (see Filter for more information). The range search mode
doesn_t need to be enabled, but you must have filled a range delimiter
in the range search input field.

If the current line is located inside a range defined by that range
filter, this function will select all lines of that range. Very useful
to copy message dumps or something like that.

*Additional entries from plugins*

There may be additional context menu entries added by plugins. Refer to
the LogExpert SDK for informations how to create own context menu
plugins. There_s one pluginin shipped with LogExpert called eminus.

*Column headers context menu*

There_s another context menu for the column headers of the tables:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_040.png[]

*Freeze columns until here*

Freezes all columns starting from left until the selected column
(including). The frozen colums will stay locked on their positions when
scrolling horizontally.

*Move (left/right/to last column)*

Reorder columns. You can also drag the columns to another position with
the mouse.

*Tab context menu*

Right-click on a tab to open its context menu.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_041.png[]

*Close this tab/Close other tabs/Close all tabs*

Guess what!

*Tab color*

Allows you to change the color for a tab. The colors are saved in a
history for the last used 40 files.

*Copy path to clipboard*

Will copy the full path (inkl. file name) of the tab_s log file to the
clipboard.

*Find in Explorer*

Will open a new Explorer window and select the log file.



*Settings*

Choose "Settings" from the Options menu to open the settings dialog. The

Settings is divided into 5 pages.

*View settings*

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_042.png[]

*Font*

Choose a font for the log file display.

*Follow tail enabled*

Configures if the Follow tail option is enabled by default.

*Filter tail enabled*

Configures if the Filter tail option is enabled by default. See Filter
for details.

*Sync filter list enabled*

Configures if Sync filter is enabled by default. See Filter for details.

*Ask before closing tabs*

If checked, you will see a "really close?" dialog when closing a tab.

*Allow only 1 instance*

If checked, only one instance of LogExpert can be started. Additional
instances will quit immediately. All files (given by command line args)
will be loaded by the one and only running instance.

*Re-open last used files*

If checked, LogExpert will load the last used files on startup.

*Show tail state on tabs*

Shows an additional LED on every file tab. The LED shows the current
state of Follow tail on every tab. See File handling for more
information. The Color button lets you choose a color for the LED.

*Set last column width*

You can force a column width for the rightmost column. Just enable the
option and adjust a value of your choice. The column with is applied
every time a Columnizer is selected (i.e. loading a file or changing the
Columnizer).

If you don_t use this option, the width of the last column is determined
automatically by using the width of the displayed lines when selecting a
Columnizer.

*Timestamp control*

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_043.png[]

Choose here if you want to see the timestamp control in the status line.
You can also choose how you want the control to operate: by left/right
dragging or by up/down dragging. See Timeshift for more information.

The options for the Time spread display are described in the Time
spread view help page.

*External tools*

The settings for the external tools are described in the External
tools section of this document.

*Columnizers*

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_044.png[]

You can set default columnizers for file names matching a file name
mask.

For adding new entries enter a file name mask into the empty field at
the last line and choose a columnizer from the list. To delete an entry
select it and click on

the Delete button.

*Mask has priority before history*

If checked, the settings in this dialog will always be used when loading
files. If not checked, the settings will only be used if no entry in the
columnizer history is found for the file to be loaded. The columnizer
history stores the last 40 file names with its columnizer selections.

*Highlight*

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_045.png[]

You can select default Highlight groups for file names matching a file
name mask.

For adding new entries enter a file name mask into the empty field at
the last line and choose a columnizer from the list. To delete an entry
select it and click on

the Delete button.

*Multi File*

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_046.png[]

This page configures how LogExpert operates if you load multiple files
at once. Multiple files can be loaded by selecting more than one file in
the Open file dialog or by drag & drop multiple files onto LogExpert.

The default behaviour is to load every file into a separate tab window.
But you can also configure that LogExpert treats the files as
MultiFile. So you can use the MultiFile feature even if your file
names don_t fit the naming convention for the automatic MultiFile
feature. Note that LogExpert cannot handle a logfile rollover with
MultiFiles correctly, if the logfiles don_t follow the naming
convention.

*Plugins*

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_047.png[]

Here you can configure the plugins, if you have any plugins available.
The config options depends on the plugin. If the plugins provides an
in-place config dialog you will see the settings directly embedded on
the Plugins tab (like in the screenshot above). If the plugin needs a
larger GUI, it can provide it_s own config dialog. In this case you will
see a "Config" button which causes the plugin to show its own dialog.

*Persistence*

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_048.png[]

Here you can choose if LogExpert saved persistence files
automatically. A persistence file is an XML files which contains
informations about a logfile. You can also select an location where to
store these files.

A persistence files has the file extension .lxp. If you Choose "Same
directory as log file" the persistence file will have the same name as
your log file (with added

.lxp). If you choose one of the other options, the persistence file name
is built from the absolute pathname of your log file (with added .lxp).

*Memory / CPU*

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_049.png[]

You can adjust the memory that uses LogExpert for buffering lines. Also
you can adjust the file polling interval for the tail mode.

*Buffer usage*

The buffer usage for every file can be adjusted. When working with large
files you should consider to increase the defaults. This will speed up
operations like filtering a lot! This is especially true when opening
log files directly from a network drive (which is not recommended for
large files).

Here_s how it works internally:

When loading files, LogExpert will group all lines into blocks. The
number of lines per block can be adjusted. When the maximum number of
blocks is reached, LogExpert will start to remove blocks from memory.
The blocks which are used least will be removed at first. As soon as one
of the lines of a removed blocks is needed again (because of scrolling
or searching/filtering) the complete block will be reloaded from the
file.

To find optimal sizes you can experiment a bit. For my system it seems
be be a good choice to have large blocks (about 500 to 3000 lines)
instead of too much blocks. But this experience may vary from system to
system.

For a better performance the buffer limit will not be checked every time
a block is added. Instead there_s a kind of garbage collector thread
which checks the number of blocks from time to time (10 secs interval
for now). This means there may be a larger memory consumption for some
seconds, before blocks are free_d by the garbage thread.

Buffer usage values count for every loaded file. If you have 10 large
files open with settings of 2000 lines/block and number of blocks = 100,
you will have

2.000.000 lines in memory. Beause the internal representation of strings
is 2- byte-Unicode, every character will take 2 bytes of memory. That
means, a 40

MB ASCII log file will consume about 80 MB memory if loaded completely.

If you_re using LogExpert mostly as a tail tool (only viewing the last
few lines), you may be happy with small buffer usage values. If you use
LogExpert for heavy _offline_ analysis of large log files, you should
try to increase buffer values (if you have enough RAM). The increased
filtering speed is worth the RAM consumption. Trust me, your live will
be easier a lot! ;)

*Multi threaded filter*

If enabled, the filter function will use multiple threads. This can
improve the speed of the filter. The real speed gain depends on the
actual system (number of processors etc.). On my dual core notebook it_s
about twice as fast if the file is completely held in memory. When the
file doesn_t fit completely in memory (buffer settings), then multi
threading can be even faster than twice. Because if some threads are
waiting for disk, the other ones can continue with filter searching in
already loaded buffers.

Currently, the number of threads started for filtering is processor
count + 2. Every thread will get a part of the logfile. When all
threads have completed, the results are merged. Because every thread
works on a different part of the logfile, the block size settings may
affect the speed, if buffer purges/reloads occure

while filtering.

*File polling interval*

You can adjust the polling interval. This is the interval a log file is
checked for changes. In most situations you should have no reason to
change the value.

The smallest allowed value is 20ms.



== Persistence

The new persistence feature added with LogExpert 1.2 allows you to
restore the state of work with LogExpert. The following data is saved
in/restored from the persistence file:

* Bookmarks and bookmark comments
* Added rowheights ("blank lines" added with the Enter key)
* Tab name
* Columnizer
* Current selected line
* Scroll position
* Follow tail state (on/off)
* Filter window state (on/off/advanced) and size
* Bookmark window state (on/off) and size
* Filter settings
* All filter tabs

So make shure to enable the automatic persistence saving in the settings
to get most fun with LogExpert.

When loading a log file LogExpert looks for the appropriate persistence
file too. If found, it will be loaded and used. You can choose a
location for the

persistence files in the settings.



== Sessions

Use the _Save session..._ entry in the File menu to save a session.
Session means that all open tabs will be saved. When loading a session
all tabs of the session will be restored (i.e. all the log files will be
opened).

A session file is a small XML file which contains references to the

persistence files of the log files. When saving a session, persistence
file saving is forced even if persistence saving is disabled in the
settings.

To load a session use the _Load session..._ menu entry. You can also
drag_n_drop a session file onto LogExpert or use a session file as
command line argument.



== _eminus_ context menu plugin

Since version 1.2 LogExpert has a plugin API to provide additional
functions. There_s one default plugin shipped with LogExpert: It_s
called _eminus_. The plugin is able to parse log lines for valid Java
stack trace entries. If a valid stack trace entry is found, the plugin
sends the Java class name and the line number via TCP/IP to it_s
counterpart: The eminus Eclipse plugin. The Eclipse plugin will load the
class into the Eclipse code editor and locate to the given line.

The Eclipse plugin can be downloaded from the LogExpert website.

=== Configuration

In the LogExpert settings you can configure the eminus plugin. Normally
you will use the localhost IP address (127.0.0.1) and a port which is
not used by other applications on your computer. If you want to
remote-control an Eclipse IDE running on another computer you can
configure its IP address. A password

is required if you have set a password in the eminus settings in your
Eclipse IDE. This is usefull to prevent your team-mates from
remote-controlling your Eclipse IDE. :)

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_050.png[]

=== How to use

Right-click on a log line with a Java stack trace entry to bring up the
context menu. the menu entry _Load class in Eclipse_ is available if a
valid stack trace entry is found.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_051.png[]

=== Eclipse plugin

Copy the eminus plugin (a jar file) into the dropins folder (or
plugins folder) of your Eclipse installation.

You can configure the plugin in the Eclipse preferences:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_052.png[]

To activate the plugin, you have to check the eminus toolbar button. If
the button is not active the plugin won_t listen for TCP/IP messages.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_053.png[]

The eminus Eclipse plugin is written by Mathias Dräger. He also does a
lot of beta testing for LogExpert since the very early development
phase.



== SFTP Plugin

LogExpert comes with an SFTP plugin. This allows to load files directly
from a remote server via SFTP.

=== Loading files

Use "File->Open URL..." and enter a URL like "sftp://<host>/<file>".
Optional a user can be specified.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_054.png[]

The plugin will ask for user and password. For every host the
credentials are cached and will not be asked again.

=== Using SSH keys

The plugin also supports authentication via SSH keys. Go to LogExpert_s
settings (plugin tab) and specify your private key file:

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_055.png[]

Note: Only one key is supported. Different per-host keys won_t work.

The key file is loaded on first use (when first file is loaded via
SFTP). You will be asked for the key_s passphrase for key decryption.
Once loaded, the key is cached as long as LogExpert is running.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_056.png[]

Now when loading a file via SFTP you only need to specify the user name
but not the password. Therefore the password field is disabled then.

image:/assets/images/pages/log_expert/image_057.png[]

If authentication via SSH keys failed for any reason, you have the
choice to try again or to fall back to password authentication.



== Regular expressions

Here are the most important regular expressions you can use in the
filter, search dialog and in the command line arguments for external
tools. There are some more, but the author is too lazy to copy them all
from the Microsoft MSDN pages (and probably it may be illegal). On the
end of the page there_s a link to the original regular expression
documentation for .NET.
